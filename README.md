# LinkLabelUI
![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.material-ui-swing/LinkLabelUI?color=orange&style=for-the-badge)

This component import a web component inside the Swing java framework.

With simple JLable component is possible to apply the "anchor" style inside the component with the text like HTML.
An example:

```
hyperlink.setText("<html><a href=''>Follow me on github @vincenzopalazzo</a></html>");
```

With HTML inside the JLabel is difficult integrate the style  with a look-and-feel.

For this reason, I developed a new component for Swing, called LinkLabelUI.

Now your question is: why the name is "LinkLabelUI" and not "LinkLabel", the reason is: this component could be integrate with a look-and-feel and the modern look-and-fell have a method to developed a personal theme, like [material-ui-swing](https://github.com/vincenzopalazzo/material-ui-swing) and I want create a simple method to integrate this component with all look-and-feel and create a simple method to integrate the style of this component inside a theme. In fact there are two different method to use the component LinkLabelUI.

## Use LinkLabelUI with with UIManager.

TODO

## Use LinkLabelUI such as a component.

## Possible result
